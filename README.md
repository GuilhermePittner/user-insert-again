# User Insert Form

### Overview 📋
This is a simple project where users can submit data through a form, and the submitted information will be displayed below the form.

### Purpose 🎥
I created this project as a practice exercise, inspired by a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gHr2Pe5LCY).

### Styling 🎨
Instead of using traditional CSS files, I opted for Tailwind CSS, which I find to be much more efficient and effective for styling.

### 🛠️ Built With:
- React/Vite
- TailwindCSS
